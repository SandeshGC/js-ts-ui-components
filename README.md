# js-ts-ui-components
Place where you can find examples of various web UI components implemented in different JS frameworks with code.

## Description
Contributions are encouraged.

## Goal
The goal is to create a website with UI components and their code. The user will see the UI components in the website, search for components by name, and view the code of the component to learn how the component can be implemented in different JS frameworks. 

### Design
- A sidebar containing names of UI components that links to the component section.
- The component section will display the component and a button to show code for that component.
- On clicking the 'show code' button, the code for the component will be shown.
- You can copy the code snippet and use it in your projects.

*** I want to include source code for implementing the source code in other frameworks too. So, feel free to create issues and lets discuss what we can do to make the project better. ***
